## Introduction

This respository contains the Dog vs Cat classifier with regularization both with TensorFlow and Pytorch


## Usage

Assuming you are in the Cats_Dogs_classification  master folder the you go in Dog_Cat_Classifier subfolder. 
You also do the same for tranfer learning subfolder

1. Preparation:
* Download the [Dog vs Cat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cn0B9Zr2irUnZcHqODT9IilGHf9fZ61R/view?usp=sharing) dataset 
* Then put them into a folder (Cat_Dog_data/ for example). Please carefully check the directory of the folder 
whether containing invalid characters or image with wrong extension. The data should be structure as follow:
* Cat_Dog_data/train/cat, Cat_Dog_data/train/dog for the training dataset
* Cat_Dog_data/test/cat, Cat_Dog_data/test/dog for the test dataset


3. cat_dog_tranfer_learning content the code of the classicication of Dog vs Cat using a pretrained model 
4. Dog_Cat_Classifier content the code for the classicication with 2 and 4 convolutions

As bonus to this repository I also build a face landmark of the student of [AMMI](https://aimsammi.org/) 2019
